Description: This package and corresponding GitHub repository are intended to
  enhance the reproducibility of a research paper. The principal investigators 
  for the study are Dr. Paula Winke (Associate Professor) and Dr. Susan Gass
 (University Distinguished Professor), both whom are at the Department of 
 Linguistics & Germanic, Slavic, Asian, and African Languages, Michigan State 
 University. The paper analyzes data on Spanish language learners who took a 
 Can-Do self-assessment test, along with the more authoritative OPIc language 
 proficiency test. We did both correlation analyses and continuation-ratio 
 models that examine the effect of course and OPIc speaking proficiency scores 
 on the passing rate for each level of the Can-Do statements self-assessment. 
 The objective was to validate the Can-Do test results.
