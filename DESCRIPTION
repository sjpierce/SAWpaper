Description: This package and corresponding GitHub repository are intended to
  enhance the reproducibility of a research paper. The principal investigators 
  for the study are Dr. Paula Winke (Associate Professor) and Dr. Susan Gass
  (University Distinguished Professor), both of whom are at the Department of 
  Linguistics, Languages, and Cultures, Michigan State University. The paper 
  analyzes data on Spanish language learners who took a Can-Do self-assessment 
  test, along with the more authoritative OPIc language proficiency test. We did 
  both correlation analyses and continuation-ratio models that examine the 
  effect of course and OPIc speaking proficiency scores on the passing rate for 
  each level of the Can-Do statements self-assessment. The objective was to 
  validate the Can-Do test results.
